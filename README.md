<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This project started at aug-2021 as a way of improving my bash programming skills, im sure it can be done better and more efficiently but this is my current approach.
It's designed to make arch installations more user friendly, it supports drive partitioning, formatting and installation of multiple packages, such as aur package managers, desktop enviorments...
The main challenge in this project was making it in one single file, i made it this way so it can be easily downloaded and used without needing to download more files even inside the main file</p>
<h2 id="todo">To-Do</h2>
<ul>
 <li>Translate it to english ;D</li>
 <li>Add Wayland support</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<code>sh -c "$(curl https://github.com/BICH0/arch-autoinstaller/releases/download/v1.2.0/arch.sh)"</code>
<h3>! IMPORTANT change the v.x.x.x with the current release, or download it from http://confugiradores.es/proyectos/arch.sh</h3>
Once the script starts follow the steps and you will be greeted by a beautifull debloated, cutting-edge, rolling-release arch install.
<h2 id="credits">Credits</h2>
